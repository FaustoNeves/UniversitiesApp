# UniversityApp

During my last in year in the college, I had android development classes. The first exam was build an app very similar to this. It had 2 screens, one for searching and the second for displaying the list, it was written in Java and the items was displayed in a List View. After the exam, I had a good app template to try out newer things. I refactored to Kotlin, removed 1 screen and used Recycler View instead of List View.

The main functionality is: you can search for education institutions. It searchs for all colleges around the world. Type any character you desire 
(or nothing, if you want to bring the whole list!) and it will search in the API for the characters that you have typed in.
The second functionality is: when you click on any university displayed on the list, you will be redirected to their respective website!
